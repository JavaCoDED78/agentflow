## Responsibility

append-only security/business audit events with immutable history.

## Data ownership

`audit` owns exactly one table and no other module may change its migration or schema: `audit_events`.

## Package layout (internal vs public)

```text
com.example.agentflow.audit/               ← public API boundary
├── domain/          pure model + invariants        internal
├── application/     use cases, transactions         public services + DTOs
├── web/             controllers + API DTOs          internal
├── persistence/     repositories, mappers, SQL       internal
└── worker/          Kafka listeners                 internal
```

`persistence`, `web`, `worker` and `domain` are internal: another module must not import them
(enforced by the architecture test, `S02-08` / `S02-09`).

## Rules

- Business rules stay in `application` (transactions) or `domain` (invariants); never in `web` or
  infrastructure.
- A new `module → module` edge requires an ADR (root `AGENTS.md`).
